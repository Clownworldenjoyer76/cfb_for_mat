### ⚠️ data/raw/games.csv — Manual File Notice

This file (`data/raw/games.csv`) is a **manually generated static dataset** containing game schedule, teams, and venue information for the current season.

Because the original automated workflows (`map_cfbd_ids`, `backfill_games_venue`, etc.) were deprecated, this file **is not automatically refreshed**.

#### When to Regenerate
- **Annually** at the start of each new season (or when the schedule changes).
- You can regenerate it by:
  1. Exporting the new season’s schedule from CFBD or another verified data source.
  2. Merging it with the current `data/reference/stadiums.csv` to populate venue info.
  3. Saving it again here as `data/raw/games.csv`.

#### Why Manual
Automated mapping via the CFBD API proved inconsistent due to team name variations and data gaps.  
This static file ensures stable, reproducible inputs for all downstream processes (situational factors, tempo metrics, etc.).
